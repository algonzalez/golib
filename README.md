# golib - Helper

`golib` is a Go module of various utility packages.

This project will serve as an test bed and experimentation tool
as a I go about learning Go. 

Keeping that in mind, code may not always be idiomatic Go
and will probably go through some churn as I try things out.
Some code may even be removed if found to be flawed or unnecessary. 

Any thoughts, comments, bug reports, and constructive criticism
will be appreciated.
