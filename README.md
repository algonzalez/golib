`golib` is a collection of various utility Go packages.

This project will serve as a test bed and experimentation tool
as a I go about learning Go. 

Keeping that in mind, code may not always be idiomatic Go
and will probably go through some churn as I try things out.
Some code may even be removed if found to be flawed or unnecessary. 

Any thoughts, comments, bug reports, and constructive criticism
will be appreciated.
